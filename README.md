# NoDelete
NoDelete is a tool that assists in the malware analysis process by collecting files that malware drops in a folder and deletes afterward.

After using **NoDelete**, all the files inside a folder cannot be deleted. It allows you to Lock a specific folder used by malware to drop files, and you will be sure that the files will not be deleted after a while. This allows you to investigate each one of them.
