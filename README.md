# NoDelete
NoDelete is a tool that assists in malware analysis by locking a folder where malware drops files before deleting them.

## Note
> This project is being created mainly for my personal studies of Qt and C++. As soon as I learn new things, I will improve it all.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me.

## Let's work!
### Update Notes 12/2024
- Added `config.ini` 
- Added logging for monitored folders
- Added ListView with paths
- Added option to open folders from ListView
- Implemented multi-threading
- Added functionality to restore original folder permissions
- Read from environment variable

### How it looks like now?
Now you can set the folder you would like to lock in a **``config.ini``** file.

### Configuration
* **Directories:** All the directories you want to monitor and lock.
* **LogFile:** Name of the log file (default is in the same path as the binary).

When **NoDelete** loads the file, it will convert the environment variables and display them in a user-friendly format.

You can also open the directory to inspect the files that the malware wrote there. Just right-click on the line and select **Open Directory**.

### Before Execution
Before running **NoDelete**, you will have full permissions on the target folder:

### After Execution
Once all folders are locked, you will see that only "Everyone" is allowed to perform specific actions:

A log will help you validate if anything went wrong and will also provide details about the success of locking the folders.

After using **NoDelete**, files inside the locked folder cannot be deleted. This allows you to lock a folder used by malware to drop files, ensuring the files remain intact for further investigation.

You can see all activities recorded in the log file:
