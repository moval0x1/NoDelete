# NoDelete
NoDelete is a tool that assists in the malware analysis process by collecting files that malware drops in a folder and deletes afterward.

## Note
> This project is being created mainly for my personal studies of Qt and C++. As soon as I learn new things, I will improve it all.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me.
